### Summary
<!--

Write a summary of how you think this song could be improved.

For the most part, everything should be as close to the original as possible.  However, some songs have additional parts that are written and played back separately as additional tracks - not part of the main arrangement.  In some cases these sections may have no guitar parts and can be considered boring, so by adding in the additional arrangements to the main arrangement, it may be more fun to learn and play!

If you have an idea that could make a song more fun to play, suggest it here!
