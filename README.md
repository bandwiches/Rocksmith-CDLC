# Rocksmith-DLC

# UPDATE 8/29/2020
This repo is basically going to become the hub for any updates on current projects as well as bug tracking and what not.  I'm re-hosting all my CDLC on Google Drive with individual links - per CustomsForge policy - so that way I don't ruffle any feathers.  You can still "subscribe" to this repo (I guess) if you want to know if I'm still active or not.  It'll be a pretty good indicator.  Anyways, once I have the last of my CDLC updated on drive, I'll be removing the individual releases.  Sorry!

- BANDWICHES

# About
These songs are custom made from various open source tabs and audio, none of these are for commercial use.  I only use high quality audio and 4+ Star Tabs. Look for the official BANDWICHES seal!

# Requirements
All songs are built using "The Smashing Pumpkins - Cherub Rock" song id.

# Quality Assurance
These are the features that I focus on
- Beat
- Tuning
- Arrangements
- Testing
- Lack of Support

### Beat Tracking
- Most of my time is spent lining up the written music with the recording
- I am a drummer first so this is very important for me

### Tuning
 - Being in tune is important

### Arrangements
 - I don't like to half-ass anything so you'll get the full arrangement for every song (Guitars, Bass, Vocals)
 - Guitar
  - Lead & Rhythm (if applicable) are always provided
  - Additional guitar parts will be added if they play a significant role
 - Bass
  - Bass is provided however the ability to play with a guitar may or may not be tested
 - Finger Positions
  - These are to the best of my ability
 - Vox
  - Vocals are always included, but lower revisions are much more "best effort"
  - I don't really focus on sustaining lyrics so much as the timing of the words & syllables
  - Vocals are improved on almost every revision
 - Keyboard
  - RS doesn't support keyboards so neither do I

### Testing
- All songs are personally tested to make sure it feels and plays accurately
 - This is subject to my personal opinion

### Lack of Support
These features are included but not supported (best effort).

- Dynamic Difficulty
  - This is automatically applied and I leave it as default
- Tones
 - I am new to guitar so I have not quite learned how to build tones yet, eventually though.
